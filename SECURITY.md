# Security Model

Filter is designed as a privacy-oriented client-side utility.

The system aims to reduce risks associated with automated or machine-based
data extraction. It does not claim to eliminate all possible threats.

---

## Design Priorities

Filter prioritizes:

- Local-only processing
- Absence of persistent storage
- Minimization of machine-readable signals
- Deterministic document export behavior

---

## Important Limitations

Filter should not be interpreted as a comprehensive security solution.

Users remain responsible for validating whether generated outputs meet
their specific legal, regulatory, or organizational requirements.

---

## Responsible Use

If you discover a reproducible security issue or unintended data exposure
scenario, please report it responsibly.
